# Changelog

## 0.7.3 (unreleased)

- **Breaking (types):** `Tether.query()` and the server's `query()` answer `Promise<object>` and
  take no type argument: Tether checks only that the answer is an object, so a type argument
  promised more than was checked. **Upgrade:** code that passed one (`query<MyShape>(…)`) checks the
  fields it reads. Documented usage (`Tether.query(text)`, `query(graphql, variables)`) is
  unchanged.
- Fix (sync Worker): a reconcile whose Webflow publish fails, or leaves items out, retries every
  product of the run on the next one, those from the retry list included. Before, every page but the
  last stayed unpublished.
- Fix (sync Worker): a reconcile stopped mid-page continues right after the last product it did,
  using Shopify's cursor, so a product edited between runs is no longer skipped. A position saved by
  an earlier release is resumed from the start of its page.
- Fix (sync Worker): products Webflow refuses to publish, after a webhook or in an import, are
  retried or reported as failures instead of being dropped silently.
- Fix (sync Worker): every `POST /reconcile` checks the Shopify webhooks and registers again any
  that Shopify deleted, and `/check` points there.
- Fix (customer accounts): a token refresh that finishes after a logout no longer restores the
  session (a new KV key, `tether-account:ended:<hash>`, marks ended sessions).
- Fix (Node sync): `serve` and a cron `reconcile` sharing `.tether-sync-state.json` no longer lose
  each other's writes (a lock file, `.tether-sync-state.json.lock`).
- Sync Worker updates: a managed file or folder a release no longer ships is removed from the copy
  instead of staying behind, and a release missing the files the update workflow runs is refused
  before anything changes. A copy without a `TETHER_VERSION` file records the minor it updated to,
  and a copy whose own version is outside its `TETHER_VERSION` range is warned on every run instead
  of reporting up to date. These come with the updater in this release, so they apply from a copy's
  next update after installing 0.7.3.
- Sync Worker copies git-ignore the updater's `.tether-update-*` work folder (a failed rollback
  keeps it for a restore by hand); copies get this with this release.
- Releases: the GitHub Release no longer carries `tether.esm.js`, which needs the `esm/` folder the
  Release doesn't ship; take the ES module build from npm. The release workflow refuses a tag whose
  commit isn't on `main` (or on its `release/X.Y` branch when that exists) before publishing
  anything, since copies refuse such a tag and it would block every copy in its range.
- Repository: the development tools' `minimatch` is overridden to 11.0.5 (GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249, a
  denial of service through glob patterns), so `npm audit` is clean; CI fails on any new advisory.
- Types: `tether:cart-updated`'s `reason` is the exported `CartUpdateReason` (`load`, `add`,
  `update`, `remove`, `note`, `attributes`, `discount`, `buyer-identity`, `pending`, `settled`), and
  the reference lists when each one fires.
- Fix: a hook option (`onError`, `formatMoney`, `warningText`, `onCartOpen`, …) that isn't a
  function logs the warning the reference promises and is ignored, instead of being dropped
  silently.

## 0.7.2 (2026-11-06)

- Fix: a 2xx answer carrying Shopify's `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, or GraphQL errors without `data` for
  a mutation, rejects with the new code `SERVER_ERROR` (`status` 200) instead of `HTTP_200`. A cart
  change that gets one is treated like a 5xx: it isn't sent again and the cart is loaded again. A
  query that gets `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` is retried.
- Fix: `Cart.clear()` removes the lines the cart has when its turn in the queue comes, so a line
  added just before it (`Cart.add(v); Cart.clear()`) is removed too.
- Types: `Tether.query()` takes the query as a string, as the docs and the server's `query()` do.
  The function its type also allowed could resend a query Shopify refused for `quantityAvailable`
  without end; such a refusal now costs at most one extra request.
- Fix: a `tether_country` cookie with a malformed escape (`%E0%A4%A`) is ignored like any other
  value that isn't a country, instead of turning off market detection (`Tether.detectMarket()`
  rejected, and the saved choice and the Webflow locale were lost with it).
- Fix: a value another script writes under the saved market's key that isn't a valid market (such as
  `{"country":"Germany"}`) is skipped by the other tabs, as on the next page, instead of reported.
- Astro starter: new projects depend on `^0.7.0`, not `^0.6.0`, so they get the 0.7 line, and the
  starter comes with a `package-lock.json`. Each release keeps the range at its minor version.

## 0.7.1 (2026-11-06)

- Fix: when a cart change fails without a clear answer (a network error, a connection that drops
  while Shopify's answer arrives, a 2xx answer that isn't valid, or a 5xx, when Shopify may or may
  not have applied it), Tether loads the cart again, so the page and the visitor's other tabs show
  what Shopify really has. The change still rejects and `tether:cart-error` still fires; a clear
  refusal (Shopify's user errors, a 4xx) works as before.
- Fix: a query whose answer stops arriving partway is retried like a network error, and rejects with
  `NETWORK` once its retries are spent.
- A 2xx answer that isn't valid (not JSON, not in the GraphQL shape, or without the data Tether
  reads) rejects with the new code `INVALID_RESPONSE` (`status` 200) instead of `HTTP_200`.
- Types: `TetherError`'s `name`, `code`, `status`, `errors` and `userErrors` are `readonly`
  (`errors` is a `readonly GraphQLError[]`). Code that assigned to them no longer type-checks;
  nothing changes at runtime.
- Docs: the `retries` option says which failures it retries: for a query a network error, a 429, a
  5xx or `THROTTLED`; for a mutation, cart changes included, only a 429 or `THROTTLED`.
- npm package: `src/` is no longer published. It imported files the package doesn't contain; the
  package's entry points, types and the script's source map (which embeds its sources) are
  unchanged.
- Fix: a market chosen in another tab is followed even after another script has replaced
  `window.Tether`.
- Fix: cart changes and other Storefront mutations are no longer sent again after a network error or
  a 5xx, when Shopify may already have applied them, so a timed-out "Add to cart" can't add the line
  twice. They are still retried on 429 and `THROTTLED`, which Shopify answers without running them;
  queries keep their retries. `Tether.query()` and the server's `query()` treat a document with a
  `mutation` the same way.
- Fix: a saved cart id that isn't a Shopify cart id (written by another script, or edited by hand)
  is forgotten instead of sent; the next change starts a new cart.
- Fix: when another script replaces `window.Tether` after the Tether script, an optional part
  (search, markets, accounts and the others) rejects its load with a clear error instead of staying
  pending.
- Sync Worker updates: a tag whose GitHub Release doesn't carry its signed
  `tether-server-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` yet (its release workflow is still running, or failed) is skipped
  with a warning; the update installs the newest release that has its file, or reports up to date,
  instead of failing the run. The misleading "set TETHER_VERSION to 0.7.0 or newer" message is gone.
  Copies get this from 0.7.1 on: until a copy has installed 0.7.1, its 0.7.0 updater still fails the
  run while a new tag's release workflow runs, and the next run after the Release is published
  installs it. Nothing needs doing.
- Sync Worker copies made from 0.6.1 to 0.6.8 still have `latest` in `TETHER_VERSION` (updates never
  change that file), so they will install 0.8.0 by themselves, and a 0.x minor can need one-time
  steps. **To stay on the 0.7 line:** write `0.7` in the file, as copies made from 0.7.0 have.
- Sync Worker README: an update also replaces `.dev.vars.example` and `.gitignore`. Lines added to
  the copy's `.gitignore` are dropped by the next update, so ignore your own files from a
  `.gitignore` in your own folder.
- Releases: the GitHub Release, with the Worker's signed file, is created before the npm publish. A
  maintenance release of an older minor line (cut from `release/X.Y`) is no longer marked as
  GitHub's latest release and goes to npm under the `latest-X.Y` dist-tag. `npm run release` tags
  only after the whole gate passes, adds a maintenance release's section to main's `CHANGELOG.md`,
  and pushes the branch, main and the tag in one atomic push, so a branch that moved meanwhile
  leaves nothing half-pushed.
- Docs: the reference no longer tells sites to load `@0.6` / `@v0.6.8`; pinning is described as
  `@X.Y` / `@vX.Y.Z`, and a test keeps release numbers out of `docs/`.

## 0.7.0 (2026-11-06)

**Before you update: one step for every deployed sync Worker.** Copies made from 0.6.1 to 0.6.8 have
`latest` in `TETHER_VERSION` unless it was changed, so they install 0.7.0 by themselves on their
next scheduled update run (Mondays by default), and Cloudflare deploys it. Before that run:

- **If the shop uses customer accounts:** add the Worker secret `ACCOUNT_SECRET` (24 or more random
  characters, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 24`, not the value of `SYNC_SECRET`) in Cloudflare → your
  Worker → Settings → Variables and Secrets. 0.6 already reads it, so it can be set now. Customers
  are logged out once.
- **Or, to wait:** write `0.6` in the copy's `TETHER_VERSION` file and commit it. The copy stays on
  0.6 until the file says `0.7`.

**If you do neither:** the Worker updates to 0.7.0 and keeps syncing products, answering webhooks
and starting deploys. Only its customer account routes answer 503 with
`accounts need the Worker secret ACCOUNT_SECRET (see /check)`, and `/check` shows the error, until
the secret is added. Workers without customer accounts need nothing. After 0.7.0 is installed, every
update run also asks you to copy the new update workflow file in, once, by hand (see "Sync Worker
updates" below).

**Until you copy that workflow file in, a failed update looks green.** The workflow that copies got
from 0.6.x pipes the updater through `tee`, so a run whose update failed still shows a green check:
it installs nothing, and the only sign is an error annotation titled `Tether update failed` on the
run (Actions → the run → Annotations). Copy the new workflow file in once, right after 0.7.0 is
installed, and a failed update fails the run from then on. Until then, look at the annotations of
each update run, or update by hand: with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed, run
`node scripts/update-tether.mjs` in the copy and commit the result (see the Worker README).

Sites that load the script from jsDelivr as `@0.6` stay on 0.6 until they change the URL; `@latest`
gets 0.7.0 at once. The breaking changes below list each one's upgrade step.

- **Breaking (script build):** every optional part carries the sha384 `integrity` hash from the
  core's own build, a `partsUrl` included, and loads with CORS when it is on another origin. A
  self-hosted `partsUrl` must serve the files of the same release as the core: upload the whole
  folder of that release and replace it together with the core. A part from another release fails to
  load. Watch builds (`--watch`) carry the hashes too, rebuilding the core when a part changes.
  **Upgrade:** sites that load parts from beside the core (jsDelivr, or the whole release folder
  self-hosted) need nothing; a `partsUrl` folder is updated with the core.
- **Breaking (sync Worker updates):** a copy installs a release only from the signed
  `tether-server-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` on its GitHub Release, after `gh attestation verify` checks that
  Tether's release workflow built it from the tag's commit (still required to be on `main`). Run by
  hand without the GitHub CLI, the updater refuses unless `--allow-unverified` is given; a check
  that fails is always refused. Releases before 0.7.0 have no signed file and can't be installed by
  the new updater. **Upgrade:** none for the updater itself: a copy's own 0.6 updater installs 0.7.0
  (0.6.8's by commit, checked against `main`; 0.6.0–0.6.7's by tag), and from then on every update
  is verified (`gh` comes with every GitHub runner). A copy made from 0.3.3–0.3.5 whose
  `TETHER_VERSION` was changed to `latest` first copies in the release's
  `.github/workflows/update-tether.yml` by hand: its updater also replaces that file, and GitHub
  refuses the push. Which copies take 0.7.0 is decided by their `TETHER_VERSION` (next item).
- **Breaking (sync Worker updates):** copies made from 0.6.1 to 0.6.8 have `latest` in
  `TETHER_VERSION` unless it was changed, so they install 0.7.0 by themselves; copies on `0.6` (made
  from 0.6.0, or changed) wait until it says `0.7`. **Upgrade:** the step at the top of this
  section.
- **Breaking (customer accounts):** accounts run only through the Worker (`account.server`), so no
  customer token is ever kept in the browser. Browser mode is removed: the `account.clientId`,
  `callbackUrl`, `tokenUrl`, `shopDomain` and `remember` options, and `Tether.account.query()`,
  `getToken()` and `handleCallback()`. An `account` config without `server` warns "customer accounts
  need the Worker since 0.7.0: set account.server" and loads nothing; a `Tether.account` function
  called without it rejects with `NOT_CONFIGURED`. Types: `account.server` is required, and the
  account answers keep their exact shapes. Visitors logged in through browser mode are logged out.
  **Upgrade (sites with `account.clientId`):** set up accounts in the Worker
  ([setup](docs/accounts.md#setup)): register `https://your-shop.com/_tether/account/callback` as
  the callback URI in Shopify, give the Worker `ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID`, `ACCOUNT_ORIGINS`,
  `STOREFRONT_TOKEN` and `ACCOUNT_SECRET`, then replace the browser options with
  `account: { server: '/_tether/account' }`. Code that called `Tether.account.query()` uses the
  fixed functions (`customer()`, `orders()`, `order()`, …) instead. Sites already on
  `account.server` only drop the removed options, which are ignored.
- **Breaking (product scope):** `scope.purchase` is the purchase itself,
  `{ kind: 'subscription', planId }` or `{ kind: 'one-time', offeredPlanId }` (the plan offered next
  to the one-time price, `null` without plans), and is read-only. `scope.planId` and assigning
  `scope.purchase` / `scope.planId` are removed. **Upgrade:** read `scope.purchase.kind` where the
  code compared `scope.purchase` to a string, `scope.plan?.id` (or the union's `planId`) for the
  plan, and change it with `scope.setPurchase(mode)` and `scope.selectPlan(ref)`.
- **Breaking (cart):** `Tether.cart.setCheckoutResolver(fn | null)` replaces
  `setCustomer({ accessToken, beforeCheckout })` and the `customerAccessToken` and `beforeCheckout`
  properties: the function answers a logged-in customer's checkout URL for the cart (`null` uses the
  cart's own), and that URL opens with `logged_in=true`. New carts no longer carry a
  `customerAccessToken` (the Worker links the cart at checkout). `Tether.cart.lastError` is
  read-only, and the undocumented `Tether.cart._commit()` is removed. Types: `CustomerLink` is gone.
  **Upgrade:** the account part sets the resolver itself; only code that called `setCustomer` or
  wrote those properties changes, to `setCheckoutResolver`.
- **Breaking (events):** `Tether.on(name, fn)` calls `fn` only for events Tether dispatched itself,
  so another script's look-alike `tether:*` event can't hand a listener a detail it didn't expect.
  The variant link (`tether-variant-url`) ignores such events too. Types: `Tether.on` takes only the
  names in `TetherEvents`; the `(name: string, fn: (detail: unknown) => …)` form is gone.
  **Upgrade:** listen with `document.addEventListener` for your own events.
- **Breaking (descriptions):** a description can't cover the page any more. It loses `class`
  attributes (a site's modal or overlay class would apply to it), the inline styles `transform`,
  `translate`, `rotate`, `scale` and `offset-*`, negative margins, and values in viewport or
  container-query units (`vw`, `cqw`, …; the latter resolve against the window outside a size
  container). Content wider than the element still isn't clipped. **Upgrade:** style descriptions
  from the site's CSS through the element Tether fills (`[tether-bind="description"] h2 { … }`), not
  with classes inside the description.
- Fix: the analytics part no longer throws on a `checkout` event without a cart.
- Security (descriptions): in an outline, shadow, filter, border-image or mask-border outset, text
  decoration or text stroke, every number but a colour must be a px length of at most 40px, so a
  description can't paint over the page with one (`outline: 5000px solid #fff` around a link, a
  unitless `border-image-outset: 100`, a `%` underline offset); values in other units or built with
  `var()` or `calc()` are removed, and so is `-webkit-box-reflect`. Negative `letter-spacing` and
  `word-spacing` are kept down to `-4px` or `-0.25em` and a negative `text-indent` down to `-40px`,
  so tight tracking in headings stays; anything beyond is removed. Ordinary shadows and outlines
  look as before.
- Size, gzipped, against 0.6.8: the `<script>` core is 28.9 KB, up from 24.8 KB. The growth pays for
  the description sanitizer, the checks on Storefront answers and the integrity hashes of the parts.
  Every part is smaller: account 4.1 KB (from 6.4, browser mode is gone), account pages 6.1 (7.3),
  diagnose 5.1 (5.5), analytics 3.0 (3.3), markets 2.5 (2.9), search 2.4 (2.5), extras 1.2 (1.4).
  The core shares with its parts only the functions they use, and the store-countries code behind
  `Tether.getLocalization()` lives in the markets part, which that function already loaded.
- Fix: until the saved cart loads, `[tether-cart-count]` shows the count from the last page only
  when the stored value is a whole number; anything else another script wrote there is ignored.
- Fix: where the browser blocks `sessionStorage` but not `localStorage`, the tokens 0.6's
  browser-mode accounts left in `localStorage` are still removed.
- Fix: a Storefront answer missing fields Tether reads (a product without prices or variants, a cart
  without lines, a page without `pageInfo`) is a `TetherError` `Invalid response (200)` (`HTTP_200`)
  instead of a crash inside the render, in the browser script and in `createStorefront()`, whose
  `getProduct(gid)` no longer reads a node of another type as a product. A malformed product fails
  the batch it was loaded in. `Tether.query()` answers stay typed by the caller.
- Fix: `tether:layout-changed` is always dispatched. A page `ScrollTrigger` whose `refresh` isn't a
  function is skipped, and an `onLayoutChange` hook or refresh that throws is reported to `onError`.
- Types: the published `Tether` type no longer includes the `<script>` build's internal `__core` and
  `__parts`, which it described wrongly.
- **Breaking (descriptions):** iframes are kept only from YouTube (`www.youtube.com`,
  `www.youtube-nocookie.com`), Vimeo's player, Loom and Wistia, so store content can't frame a
  look-alike login page; an iframe from any other origin is removed. Kept embeds look as before.
  **Upgrade:** list other players in the new `embedOrigins` option (bare https origins, e.g.
  `['https://player.example.com']`); an entry that isn't one is skipped with a warning.
- **Breaking (Barba preset):** `barbaPreset()`'s `gsap`, `lenis` and `scrollTrigger` take only
  getters (`() => lenis`), as their types always said; a value throws a `TypeError` when the preset
  is made. **Upgrade:** wrap the value in a function.
- Fix (Barba preset): the default `scrollTrigger` getter calls `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after an
  async render again; it was skipped because ScrollTrigger is a class.
- Types: `barbaPreset()` returns its hooks as set (not `| null`); a product option value's `swatch`
  is typed (`{ color, image: { previewImage } }`) instead of `unknown`; the Astro integration
  accepts `siteUrl` and `pageSize`, so the config shared with `createStorefront()` type-checks (both
  are still left out of the page).
- Types: `ResolvedTetherConfig.domain` is a `ShopDomain` (or `''`) and `apiVersion` an `ApiVersion`
  (or `'unstable'`), branded where the config is read; `TetherOptions` still takes plain strings.
- **Breaking (errors):** the codes `NOT_ALLOWED`, `SESSION_ENDED` and `TOKEN_FAILED`, which nothing
  raises since accounts run through the Worker, are removed, and `TetherError.code` is exactly
  `TetherErrorCode` (Shopify's own codes for refused input are on `userErrors`). **Upgrade:** drop
  checks for those codes.
- **Breaking (sync Worker):** `GET /_tether/account/orders` answers the orders as the browser reads
  them (every selected field present, `null` when Shopify leaves it out, only the selected fields),
  read by the same module (`server/src/shared/account-orders.ts`) in the Worker and the browser. An
  order without an id makes the route answer 502 instead of sending it on. **Upgrade:** none for
  sites using `Tether.account.orders()`; code reading `/orders` itself gets the same fields.
- **Breaking (types):** the Shopify objects are typed exactly as Tether's queries select them:
  `ShopifyProduct`, `ShopifyVariant`, `ShopifyCart` and `ShopifyCartLine` have no index signature
  and no optional fields Shopify always sends, a cart line's `merchandise` is `ShopifyCartVariant`,
  `ShopifySellingPlan` always has its `group`, and the new `ShopifySellingPlanNode`,
  `ShopifySellingPlanGroup`, `ShopifySellingPlanAllocation`, `ShopifyMetafield`,
  `SellingPlanAdjustmentValue`, `PlanAdjustment`, `ProductWithPlans` and `VariantWithPlans` name the
  rest. `Tether.plans` takes what each helper reads and answers typed allocations and adjustments.
  `InitialState` declares `unavailable`. The Astro integration's `hooks` is typed as the
  `astro:config:setup` hook it registers. **Upgrade:** code that read fields Tether doesn't query
  through the index signature reads them from its own `Tether.query()` result instead.
- **Breaking (types):** the published declarations are generated from the source (now TypeScript) by
  `tsc` at build time, in `dist/types/`, so they can't drift from the code. Where the hand-written
  ones differed, they now say what the code does: `TetherError` is a type export of
  `@occluze/tether` (the class is `Tether.TetherError`, and a value export of
  `@occluze/tether/server`), `Tether.on(name, fn)` takes the names of the events Tether dispatches
  (`TetherEvents`) and types each one's detail, `scope.setPurchase()` takes
  `'one-time' | 'subscription'`, `Tether.mount()` takes a `Document` or an `Element`, and
  `createStorefront()` names the `.env` keys it reads instead of taking any key. The types a site
  imports keep their names (`TetherConfig`, `Tether`, `ShopifyProduct`, `ShopifyCart`, `Storefront`,
  `InitialState`, the account answers, …), and `window.Tether` and `window.TETHER_CONFIG` stay
  declared. **Upgrade:** a site that imported `TetherError` from `@occluze/tether` as a value (it
  was never exported there at run time) uses `Tether.TetherError`.
- The source is TypeScript. The sync Worker and its CLI run it unbuilt through Node's type
  stripping, so they need Node 22.18 or newer; the browser builds in `dist/` are unchanged. Deployed
  Worker copies keep working: `src/entry.js`, `bin/tether-sync.js` and `scripts/update-tether.mjs`,
  which their wrangler config and pinned workflow name, stay as one-line JavaScript shims.
  **Upgrade:** none for Worker copies whose update workflow runs on Node 22.18 or newer (GitHub's
  `setup-node` with `node-version: 22` installs the latest 22). A host that runs the Node CLI
  (`tether-sync`) itself needs Node 22.18 or newer: update Node there before updating Tether.
- **Breaking (server):** `initialState(product)` throws a `TetherError` for a product without
  variants (Shopify always sends at least one), so its non-null overload holds; `initialState(null)`
  is still `null`. **Upgrade:** none for Shopify data.
- Customer accounts: on start the core removes the tokens Tether 0.6's browser-mode accounts left in
  `sessionStorage` / `localStorage` (`<prefix>:account:<domain>`,
  `<prefix>:account-login:<domain>`), so a full-scope refresh token doesn't stay behind. This
  cleanup is removed again in 0.8.0.
- Sync Worker: a repeated webhook delivery is also dropped across the Worker's isolates in a data
  centre, through Cloudflare's Cache API (`caches.open('tether-webhook-deliveries')`, kept six
  hours, without KV writes). This works only when the webhooks are registered on the shop's own
  domain (a route or custom domain): on `workers.dev` a repeat that reaches another isolate is
  synced again, which costs one Shopify read and one KV read and writes nothing. Node keeps the
  in-process check only.
- Fix (sync Worker): a login or logout started from a very long page address no longer fails as
  `?account=error` with a misleading login-CSRF log line. The pending login fits in its cookie for
  any address the Worker accepts; one that wouldn't comes back to the site's home, with a warning in
  the log. A cookie longer than any the Worker sets reads as absent.
- Sync CLI: the `Webflow requests` count is right with Webflow and `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` together (it
  stayed at 0).
- **Breaking (sync Worker):** customer accounts need `ACCOUNT_SECRET` (24+ random characters); the
  session key no longer falls back to `SYNC_SECRET`, the `/reconcile` and `/check` password. Without
  it the account routes answer 503 `accounts need the Worker secret ACCOUNT_SECRET (see /check)` and
  log `account setup ACCOUNT_SECRET is not set`; the sync, webhooks and deploys are unaffected, and
  `/check` shows an error step that says what to set. An `ACCOUNT_SECRET` equal to `SYNC_SECRET` is
  refused the same way (the routes answer 503 `accounts are not set up (see /check)`), since anyone
  with the `/check` password could otherwise open customer sessions. **Upgrade:** the step at the
  top of this section; a Worker that copied `SYNC_SECRET` into `ACCOUNT_SECRET` sets one of its own
  (customers are logged out once).
- Sync Worker updates: when a release ships a newer `.github/workflows/update-tether.yml` than the
  copy's (its `# Tether workflow revision:` line), the update run prints a GitHub Actions warning
  and adds the one-time manual step to the job summary. **Upgrade notes, for any later release that
  raises it:** copy `server/.github/workflows/update-tether.yml` from that release over the same
  file in your copy and commit it, once, by hand (GitHub doesn't let the workflow change its own
  file; keep your own `cron` line). 0.7.0 ships revision 3: separate jobs, the release's tests run
  with a read-only token that isn't kept in the checkout, actions pinned by commit, and the update
  uploaded with its sha256 as a job output before the release's tests run, so `publish` applies it
  only when the hash matches and the tests can't change what is pushed. Copies deployed before 0.7.0
  have revision 1 (no revision line). Their 0.6 updater installs 0.7.0 without a warning; from then
  on every update run warns, also a run that finds nothing new, until the copy has the new workflow.
  The warning and the job summary link to the release's workflow file. **Upgrade (every copy
  deployed before 0.7.0):** do that one-time copy once 0.7.0 is installed. Until then the copy keeps
  updating with its old workflow, whose test step holds a token that can write to the copy's
  repository.
- Releases: `release.yml` builds `tether-server-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` (a `git archive` of the tag's
  `server/`, the same bytes on every run), attests it (`actions/attest-build-provenance`, pinned)
  and uploads it to the GitHub Release. The release runs the whole gate (`npm run check`);
  dependencies are installed only in a read-only job, the server asset is built and attested in a
  job that installs nothing, and npm publishes with `--ignore-scripts`.
- Fix (sync Worker): only the exact example values from the docs (`your-store.myshopify.com`,
  `choose-a-long-random-string`, `shpat_…`, …) count as unset. A real value that starts with `todo`,
  `example` or `xxx`, or contains `...`, was silently ignored (e.g.
  `WEBFLOW_OWNED=todo-notes,description`) and is now used.
- Fix (sync Worker updates): a copy's update tests no longer read the copy's own `TETHER_VERSION` or
  `tether-sync.config.js`, so a copy on `latest` or a pinned version, or with its own mapping, no
  longer fails its update run. A test installs this release into a v0.6.8 copy with v0.6.8's own
  updater and runs the copy's tests.
- Releases: the signing job installs an exact npm (11.21.1); esbuild, jsdom and Playwright are
  pinned exactly. The build finds GraphQL template literals with TypeScript's parser instead of by
  pairing backticks, which a backtick in a regular expression could throw off.
- Fix (sync Worker updates): when the updater fails, it prints a `Tether update failed` error
  annotation with the cause, plus the "workflow file outdated" warning and job-summary step, before
  exiting non-zero. A copy still on the workflow made before 0.7.0 pipes the updater through `tee`
  without `pipefail`, so there the run stays green and installs nothing, and the annotation is the
  only sign of the failure. Copying in the 0.7.0 workflow (revision 3) makes a failed update fail
  the run.
- Fix (sync Worker): `MAX_SUBREQUESTS` must be a whole number from 1 to 10000000 and
  `DEPLOY_HOOK_MIN_SECONDS` one from 0 to 86400. Any other value (`-1`, `1e3`, `45.9`) uses the
  default (45, 60), and `/check` reports it as an error naming the setting. A negative
  `MAX_SUBREQUESTS` used to stop every sync at once, and `1e3` meant 1.
- Customer accounts: the Worker reads the login's `locale` and `country` the way the browser does: a
  value that isn't a language or country code is left out (with a warning in the Worker log) instead
  of being repaired, so `U1S` no longer becomes `US`. `locale` goes to Shopify as a language tag:
  `de-DE` is sent as `de`, `pt-BR` stays `pt-BR`.
- Fix (customer accounts): `ACCOUNT_ORIGINS` entries are compared the way browsers send `Origin`:
  case, a default `:443` and a trailing slash no longer matter (`https://Shop.com:443/` matches
  `https://shop.com`). An entry that isn't an https origin alone (a path, a user name, `http:`) is a
  `/check` error that names it, and the account routes answer 503 until it's fixed, instead of
  refusing every request without saying why.
- Fix (customer accounts): a logout whose ticket is too long for a cookie no longer logs a warning
  that blames the page's address.
- Repository: CI also lints the workflows with actionlint and zizmor, each downloaded at a pinned
  version and checked against its published hash.
- Repository: CI runs `npm run check` on pull requests and pushes to `main`, on Node 22.18 and 24.
- Repository: browser, Node-side, Worker and test code are type-checked as separate programs
  (`tsc -b`), so browser code can't use Node globals and the Worker can't use the DOM; the tests are
  type-checked too, with their fakes checked against the interfaces they stand in for.
- Types: `ApiVersion` is the template literal `` `${number}-${'01' | '04' | '07' | '10'}` `` (it was
  a branded string), and the API version constants are typed `ApiVersion`.
- Security: descriptions lose `id` attributes (they could clobber `window.<id>` and the site's own
  ids), inline style declarations that position content over the page or load from elsewhere
  (`position`, `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left`/`inset`, `z-index`, any value with `url(`,
  `expression(` or `@import`), and iframes from the site's own origin; an iframe's `allow` keeps
  only `autoplay`, `encrypted-media`, `picture-in-picture`, `fullscreen`, `clipboard-write`,
  `accelerometer`, `gyroscope` and `web-share`. **Behaviour change:** inline styles are written back
  as the browser parses them (`color:red` becomes `color: red;`); the look is the same.
- Config: an unknown `TETHER_CONFIG` key (a typo) warns and is left out of the config. `partsUrl` is
  checked when Tether starts: one that is neither https nor on the site warns and the parts load
  beside the core. `markets.detect` takes a single source name too, and
  `Tether.detectMarket(markets)` validates the `markets` it is given. **Behaviour change:**
  `Tether.config` is a read-only view of the live config: a write throws in strict-mode code and
  warns (`Tether.init(options)` changes it).
- Analytics: only events Tether itself sent become analytics events; a look-alike `tether:*` event
  from another script sends nothing (and no longer throws inside the analytics part).
- `observe`: each burst of added elements is mounted once, reading only their own hydrate tags and
  rendering the cart once, instead of rescanning the document per element.
- A `data-tether-hydrate` entry without the lists and prices a render walks is skipped, and the
  product loads from Shopify.
- A failed mount after `astro:page-load`, a failed render after add-to-cart and a failed refresh of
  a server-rendered product are reported (or handled) instead of surfacing as unhandled rejections.
- `@inContext` is added after reading the operation header with strings and comments blanked out: a
  `)` in a variable's default value no longer misplaces it, and the word `@inContext` in a comment
  or the selection set no longer stops it. An operation that names its own `@inContext` keeps it.
- Script build: a part file that loads but doesn't register is tried again on next use. **Behaviour
  change:** when the core was not loaded by a `<script src>` (so its folder is unknown) and there is
  no `partsUrl`, loading a part fails with a message saying so, instead of fetching it from the site
  root.
- Cart: `Tether.cart.lines`, `Tether.cart.warnings` and the `subscribe` meta's `warnings` are
  copies; `lastError` is always an `Error` or `null`; `add()` rejects if Shopify answers without a
  cart.
- Astro integration: `createStorefront()`'s own options in a shared `shop.config.js` (`siteUrl`,
  `pageSize`, `fetch`) are left out of the page; any other unknown option warns at build time.
- Types (also covered by the generated declarations above): the `TetherError` constructor takes
  typed `errors`/`userErrors`/`code`; `Tether.config` is `ResolvedTetherConfig`; `query()` defaults
  to `unknown` instead of `any`; `onError` receives `unknown` (a handler may still type it
  narrower); cart changes that can answer without a cart return `ShopifyCart | null` and
  `checkout()` the checkout URL; `imageUrl()` returns `url` itself when it is empty; an
  `initialState` plan's price and an image's `width`/`height` can be `null`; `__core` and `__parts`
  are declared.
- Releases: the version is set in `package.json` only; the release script writes every copy from it
  (`scripts/versions.ts`), and a test checks they agree.
- Security: descriptions (`tether-bind="description"`, `tether-collection-bind="description"`) go
  through an allow-list of content elements and attributes. **Behaviour change:** `<style>` blocks
  and form fields are removed, unknown elements are unwrapped (their text stays), iframes are kept
  only with an https `src` and run sandboxed with a strict referrer policy, and links that open a
  new tab get `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. Text formatting, inline styles, images, links, tables and
  video embeds render as before.
- Security: the optional parts loaded from the core script's own folder carry a sha384 `integrity`
  hash from the same build, so a core pinned with `integrity` runs only its own parts. **Behaviour
  change:** a core on another origin loads its parts with CORS (jsDelivr sends the headers; a
  self-hosted copy on another domain must too).
- Security (sync Worker): a repeated webhook delivery (same `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id`) is dropped
  within the Worker instance, and across the data centre on the shop's own domain (see above), after
  the signature and shop checks.
- Security (sync Worker): a new login ends the session the browser already had. A failed login,
  callback or logout step sends the visitor back to the site with `?account=error` (and clears the
  login cookies) instead of a raw 502 answer.
- Security (sync Worker updates): only `v`-prefixed tags are releases; an update is staged and
  swapped in, and rolled back when it fails part-way.
- Config: every `TETHER_CONFIG` option is validated once. **Behaviour change:** an invalid value
  warns in the console and falls back to its default: `apiVersion` must be quarterly (or
  `unstable`), `domain` a host name, `locale` a locale `Intl` accepts; `country` and `language` are
  normalised to Shopify's codes (`'de'` → `DE`); the `account` URLs must be a site path or https
  (http on localhost); invalid fields of `markets`, `analytics` and `account` are dropped.
- Analytics: `shopify: { proxy: true }` is the documented form; any value still turns it on.
- Customer accounts: a failed login fires `tether:account-error` with `{ error }`: `'error'` or
  `'expired'` (`?account=error` / `?account=expired`).
- Customer accounts: `customer()` has one shape (`id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `displayName`,
  `emailAddress`, `defaultAddress`; missing fields are `null`, and `id` is included); logged out,
  `customer()` is `null` and `orders()` `[]`. Refused input is `INVALID` (with `userErrors`), an
  unreachable Worker `NETWORK`.
- Customer accounts (sync Worker): a refresh refused for any reason but `invalid_grant` answers 502
  and keeps the session; a session without a refresh token no longer asks Shopify; discovery falls
  back to the shop id only on a 403/430 from the store domain.
- `Tether.cart.forgetSaved()`: forgets this device's cart and shows an empty one.
- Amounts Tether adds up or subtracts (totals, savings) are taken in each currency's own smallest
  unit (JPY whole, KWD three decimals) instead of hundredths.
- `productUrl()` (browser links and `@occluze/tether/server`) gives no link (`null`) for a missing
  handle or id instead of `/product/null`, and encodes the handle.
- A token without inventory access gets queries without `quantityAvailable`; `Tether.query()` texts
  are sent as written.
- Storefront answers that are malformed reject with a `TetherError` instead of a `TypeError`.
- Sync Worker: `/health` answers `{ ok: true }` only; the public `/check` answers only
  `{ ok, steps }` with each step's title and level. The running version and the KV binding need the
  bearer secret (`Authorization: Bearer <SYNC_SECRET>` on `/check`).
- Sync Worker: a customer account request body over 64 KiB is answered 413, and a larger declared
  `Content-Length` is refused before the body is read.
- Sync Worker: the Node server logs the address it really bound.
- Types: `Tether.account` methods return their real shapes (`AccountCustomer`, `AccountOrder`,
  `OrderDetail`, `SubscriptionContract`, …), `TetherErrorCode` lists every code, `TetherEvents` has
  the account, search and list-rendered events, and `productUrl()` returns `string | null`.
- The Storefront, Customer Account and Admin API versions live in one place
  (`server/src/shared/api-versions.ts`).

## 0.6.8 (2026-11-06)

- Security: the market's country and language are checked before they go into a query's
  `@inContext`. A `<meta name="tether-page-language">` or a saved market could otherwise change the
  query text. A language such as `nl-NL` is now sent as `NL` instead of the invalid `NL_NL`.
- Security (sync Worker): the cached Shopify Admin token is stored encrypted in KV, with a key
  derived from `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`. After the update, the Worker asks Shopify for a new token
  once.
- Security (sync Worker): a webhook without the `X-Shopify-Shop-Domain` header is refused (403).
  Shopify always sends it.
- Security: product and collection descriptions (`tether-bind="description"`,
  `tether-collection-bind="description"`) are sanitized. Scripts, event handlers and `javascript:`
  links are removed; markup, styles, images, links and video embeds stay. A description that relied
  on a script in its HTML no longer runs it.
- Security: the Astro integration refuses a secret Shopify token (`shpat_`, `shpss_`, …), because it
  would be written into every page. It warns when the token comes from a name without `PUBLIC_`.
- Security: a background image URL is escaped for CSS, and checkout only opens an https URL.
- Security: `partsUrl` must be https or on the site's own origin.
- Security (sync Worker): the public `/check` shows only each step's title and level. Details and
  the API tests need `Authorization: Bearer <SYNC_SECRET>`.
- Security (sync Worker): webhooks over 1 MB are refused (413), and a webhook is accepted only for
  the configured store.
- Security (sync Worker): customer accounts no longer accept an example value as the session key.
  `/check` recommends a separate `ACCOUNT_SECRET` instead of reusing `SYNC_SECRET`.
- Security (sync Worker): account discovery never guesses Shopify's endpoints. The id token must
  name its signing key, and `iat`/`nbf` are checked.
- Security (sync Worker updates): a release is installed by the commit its tag points at, and only
  when that commit is on the upstream default branch.
- Customer accounts (server mode): parallel requests share one token refresh. A failed cart unlink
  at logout is logged.
- Astro integration: `.env` files are read on Windows too.
- The core script is about 21 KB gzipped (was 20 KB).

## 0.6.7 (2026-11-05)

- Astro: the first page load no longer mounts twice (the injected script and ClientRouter's first
  `astro:page-load`), so account pages send each request once instead of twice.
- Account pages: a second submit or click while a request is still running does nothing (no
  duplicate address, return or subscription change from a double click or Enter).
- Addresses: on an edit, a field cleared in the form (apartment, phone) is cleared in Shopify too.
- Addresses and subscriptions: a failed load keeps what's shown and sets `addresses-error` /
  `subscriptions-error` (new `tether-show` values) instead of showing "none yet".
- Profile: after saving, `tether-account-bind` shows the new name.
- Subscriptions: `tether-subscription-state="done"` lands on the row as shown after the update.
- Orders: a tracking link without a URL is hidden; after a return request only `return-requested`
  shows, not `has-returns` as well.
- Cart: `setAttributes`, `applyDiscount` and `removeDiscount` called quickly in a row no longer undo
  each other (each reads the cart in its turn).
- Checkout asks Shopify for the checkout URL and the account's own URL side by side.
- Account: the order list and the account pages load side by side.
- Sync: a deploy hook that can't be reached keeps the rebuild pending for the next run.
- Account pages: the profile and address forms are handled before a page router (Astro's
  ClientRouter) sees the submit, so the router no longer navigates with the form fields in the URL.

## 0.6.6 (2026-11-05)

- Sync (Node CLI file store): a write from another process in the same coarse timestamp tick (common
  on Linux) is no longer missed; the store compares size and inode as well as mtime. This also made
  the sync's update check fail on some GitHub runners.

## 0.6.5 (2026-11-05)

**Customer accounts on your own site:** order pages (lines, totals, addresses, tracking), profile
and address editing, subscriptions (skip, pause, resume, cancel) and return requests, in both server
and browser mode, with markup attributes and empty/loading states ([guide](docs/accounts.md)). Only
the login, checkout and card changes stay on Shopify. In server mode each is a fixed Worker
operation with validated input; a customer can only act on their own orders, addresses and
subscriptions. A new optional part (6 KB) loads only on pages that use them.

Fixes from a full security audit (Cloudflare's security-audit method; details in the release notes):

- **Sync webhooks:** the `X-Shopify-Topic` header isn't covered by Shopify's signature, so it no
  longer decides on its own: every webhook asks Shopify for the product, and an item is only removed
  when Shopify no longer has the product. Before, a replayed signed webhook with the topic changed
  to `products/delete` could take a live product off the site.
- **`tether-sync serve` (Node):** routes before reading the body, accepts bodies up to 1 MB (413
  above), and an aborted upload no longer stops the process. New `--host` option (e.g. `127.0.0.1`
  behind a proxy).
- **Test server (`e2e/serve.mjs`, development only):** serves only files inside its folders and
  listens on 127.0.0.1.

## 0.6.4 (2026-11-05)

- Customer accounts, server mode: the Worker asks for Shopify's signing keys with JSON headers (a
  request from a Worker without them can get a bot-protection page instead of the keys), and says
  clearly when the keys can't be fetched.

## 0.6.3 (2026-11-05)

- Customer accounts, server mode on a deployed Worker: login failed with "account error" because the
  store domain's bot protection answers 403 to Workers for its `.well-known` files. The Worker now
  finds the shop id through the Storefront API and uses Shopify's account addresses directly (needs
  `STOREFRONT_TOKEN`, which server mode already asks for).

## 0.6.2 (2026-11-05)

From testers building an Astro store from the starter:

**Fixes**

- Cart: quick +/− clicks no longer step the count and totals through every reply from Shopify (+ + +
  − from 1 showed 2, 3, 4, 3). Only the latest quantity is sent; a click that undoes the last one
  sends nothing.
- A wrong token (or an Admin token, `shpat_…`) now says so, naming the store: Shopify's 401 has no
  message, so the error (and `astro build`'s output) was empty.
- `hydrate(products, { card: true })` keeps two images per product (a hover image,
  `tether-bind="image:2"`), `images: n` for more. Cards with a second image showed the first one
  until the background refresh.
- `diagnose()`: documented values (`tether-show="search-empty"`, `logged-in`, `logged-out`) are no
  longer called unknown. It now finds typos, with a suggestion: `tether-bind="pric"`, attributes
  like `tether-bnd` or `tether-add-to-card`, and an option list for an option the product doesn't
  have. Clearer messages, with no empty or `undefined` parts.
- Types: `initialState(product)` is non-null for a product (strict `astro check` passes with the
  docs' examples). `show` has `plenty-in-stock` and `has-savings`. `getProduct()` and
  `getProducts({ query })` take `null`/`undefined`. A typo in `createStorefront()` options is now a
  type error.
- Astro integration: in dev, a change to `src/shop.config.js` restarts the dev server, so the
  browser gets the new config too (`watch` for other files). `.env` files follow `--mode`, and the
  store variables are declared through `astro:env`.

**New**

- `account.server` can be a path on your own site (`'/_tether/account'`).
- Accounts: `tether-show="orders-loading"` / `"orders-empty"`, `tether-order-bind="image"`, and
  `tether-order-lines` with `tether-order-line="title|variant-title|quantity|image"`.
- `tether-products="url:q"`: search results for the page's `?q=` on a static site.
- `tether-max-width` / `data-max-width` (and `-max-height`, `-crop`): valid HTML for image sizes.

**Starter and docs**

- README: the three ways to install side by side (script tag via jsDelivr, npm, with the Worker),
  with when to pick each.
- The Astro starter has `site`, canonical links, a favicon, a 404 page, a static search page,
  `tsconfig.json`, and no longer ignores `package-lock.json`. The first cards and the first product
  image load eagerly (`fetchpriority="high"`), the rest lazily.
- Astro guide: `astro:assets` `<Image>` makes images download twice with Tether (use `<img>`), fonts
  with `<ClientRouter />`, search pages need SSR (or `url:q`), a null check for unknown collections,
  `prerender` with SSR, and `revalidate: false` for SSR pages.

## 0.6.1 (2026-11-04)

**Customer accounts, server mode: fixes from an independent security review** (nothing critical was
found; every finding is fixed and has a test):

- Login CSRF: the pending login is now sealed in an HttpOnly cookie in the browser that started it,
  so a login link from someone else can't log a visitor into the wrong account. As a result, nothing
  is written to KV before a real login (no quota abuse by anonymous requests).
- `/login` no longer takes a cart; carts are only linked through the protected `POST /cart`.
- Logout can't fail open: the session is ended and the cookie cleared first, even when Shopify is
  down. The id token for Shopify's logout goes through a one-time HttpOnly cookie, never the page.
- Sessions have an absolute lifetime (`ACCOUNT_SESSION_DAYS`), end when Shopify ends them, and
  survive two requests refreshing at once.
- A separate encryption key per purpose, bound to its KV key; optional `ACCOUNT_SECRET`.
- Order links must be https; stricter cart ids; no setup details in public errors.

**Sync:** new deploys follow every release (`TETHER_VERSION` is `latest`).

**Docs:** the comparison covers 0.6 (accounts, search, analytics, frameworks).

## 0.6.0 (2026-11-04)

Found by 10 agents building stores from the docs alone (Astro static and SSR, plain HTML, Vite,
SvelteKit, Next.js, Eleventy, subscriptions, multi-market, an accessible React cart) and 10 more
shopping in them (phone, keyboard only, screen reader, German, French, US, bargain hunter, …).

**New: optional parts** (each loads only on pages that use it; the main script stays 20 KB)

- **Search as you type** (`tether-search`, 2 KB): Shopify's predictive search with products,
  collections and suggested searches; keyboard and screen-reader friendly.
- **Customer accounts** (4 KB): login on Shopify's page, the customer's name and orders, a checkout
  that knows them. **Server mode** (recommended): your sync Worker does the login (OAuth with PKCE,
  the id token's signature checked), keeps the tokens encrypted in KV and gives the browser only an
  HttpOnly session cookie, so no Shopify token ever reaches the browser. Browser mode for quick
  starts. Both tested on a real store. [Guide](docs/accounts.md).
- **Analytics** (`analytics`, 3 KB): GA4 / Tag Manager ecommerce events in `dataLayer`, Shopify's
  own analytics (experimental, through Shopify's scripts), or `onEvent` for any tool.
  [Guide](docs/analytics.md).
- **Structured data:** `shop.jsonLd(product)` for Google's product results.
- **Other markets on static sites:** `html.tether-market-pending` until the visitor's prices are in.
- **Real-browser tests** (36, in Chromium, WebKit, Firefox and a phone, on every push): the starter,
  a plain HTML page with the `<script>` build and its optional parts, GA4 events, the market marker,
  and Shopify analytics with Shopify's real scripts (their sends intercepted).

**Fixes**

- **Stale prices:** Shopify caches the answer to an identical query text, prices included, for hours
  after a change. Tether's queries now carry a one-minute time marker (`maxAge`, default 60
  seconds), so the server module, builds and pages get current prices. (The cart always had them, so
  a page could show one price and checkout charge another.)
- Two quick clicks on cart +/− counted once; they now add up, show at once, and the line gets
  `is-busy` until Shopify answers. `Tether.cart.changeQuantity(lineId, ±1)` does the same for your
  own buttons; `Tether.cart.quantityOf(line)` shows the pending quantity.
- Clicking an option value that's unavailable with the current choices threw the other choices away.
  It now picks the closest variant that has the value; a value no variant has is ignored.
- View Transitions into a page built for another market (`/de/`) kept the old market. New:
  `<meta name="tether-page-country|language|locale">` makes a page that market, also back again.
- With the Astro integration, a visitor's saved money format lost to the config on every page.
- The country select now takes the language (or none) from the `markets.locales` entry for that
  country, instead of keeping the previous one.
- `Tether.cart.open()` did nothing without a `tether-cart-drawer` (React/Svelte/Vue carts); it now
  sets the open state for `subscribe`.
- `tether-show="list-empty"`, `list-filled` and `tether-load-more` ignored the `hidden` attribute.
- A closed cart drawer is `inert`: its buttons are no longer in the Tab order.
- `applyDiscount()` with a code Shopify doesn't accept rejects (`INVALID_DISCOUNT`) and doesn't keep
  the code; the form also sets `aria-invalid`. Repeated warnings are shown once.
- Recommendations for a missing product are no longer reported to `onError`.

**New**

- Cart warnings per line: `tether-line="warning"`, `is-warning`, `tether-line-show="warning"`, and
  `warningText(w)` to translate Shopify's messages. Cart lines carry
  `merchandise.quantityAvailable`.
- Shareable variant links: `variantUrl: true` (or `tether-variant-url`) keeps `?variant=` in the
  URL.
- Tabs stay in sync: a cart change or market switch in one tab updates the others. The cart count
  shows its last known value at once on the next page, instead of 0.
- `tether-show="plenty-in-stock"`, `lowStock` (default 5), `tether-plan-bind="option"`,
  `tether-recommendations="url:handle"` (or empty inside a product).
- Savings in the locale's format (`30 %` in German and French); `shop.formatPercent()`.
- `checkout-charge` counts the quantity.
- Server: `hydrate(products, { card: true })` for lists (about 40% smaller); `initialState()` gains
  `has-savings`, `plenty-in-stock`, `plans`, `savings` and a plain `unavailable` map; `lowStock`.
- `diagnose()` shows the market in use and warns about product options the page offers no way to
  choose.
- Types: `seo`, `setCountry` options (`locale`, `language: null`), the new config options.
- Docs: [other frameworks](docs/frameworks.md) (Next.js, SvelteKit, Vite, Eleventy); many attributes
  and classes that were only in the code are now in the reference.

The main script is 20.1 KB gzipped (18.5 KB in 0.5): the fixes above. Bundles, tab sync and variant
links moved to the optional `extras` part (1 KB).

## 0.5.0 (2026-11-04)

**Astro** ([guide](docs/astro.md), [starter](examples/astro)): Shopify product pages built at build
time (or per request with SSR), with live prices, stock, variants, subscriptions and the cart.

- `@occluze/tether/astro`: an integration that adds Tether to every page, configured from `.env`
  (`PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_DOMAIN`, `PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN`).
- `@occluze/tether/server`: `createStorefront()` for build-time and server data: `getProduct`,
  `getProducts`, `allProducts`, `getCollection`, `allCollections`, `getRecommendations`,
  `formatMoney`, `productUrl`, `imageUrl`, `query`. Same product shape as the browser.
- Hydration: `shop.hydrate(products)` puts the data in the page; the browser renders it without a
  request and refreshes prices and stock once in the background, batched for the whole page
  (`revalidate: false` to skip). Server-rendered images and products loaded earlier in the visit are
  kept.
- View Transitions (`<ClientRouter />`) work by themselves: each page is mounted, the cart closes on
  navigation (`astro: false` to turn off).
- `shop.initialState(product)`: what Tether shows first (variant, price, purchase mode, every
  `tether-show` condition, unavailable options), so server-rendered pages don't change when the
  script takes over. Same rules as the browser, covered by a test that compares the two.
- `Tether.cart.subscribe(fn)` for React, Svelte and Vue islands, with `loaded` (saved cart known)
  and `warnings`. `Tether.cart.loaded`, `Tether.imageUrl()`.
- `getRecommendations()` also takes a handle (server and browser), so it runs next to
  `getProduct()`.

**Sync: rebuild on change.** `DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` starts a build of a statically built site (Cloudflare
Pages, Netlify, Vercel) when product content changes; stock changes don't. At most one build per
`DEPLOY_HOOK_MIN_SECONDS` (60). Works with or without Webflow.

**Fixes** (found by first-time users building with the docs only):

- `tether-show` elements hidden before the script ran (a class, `style="display:none"`, `hidden`)
  are now shown when their condition applies, for every condition, not only error/not-found.
- Cart line links (`tether-line="url"`) open the variant that's in the cart.
- `tether-checkout` gets `is-disabled` / `aria-disabled` while the cart is empty.
- Cart warnings: asking for more than is in stock used to change the quantity silently. Shopify's
  message now shows in `tether-show="cart-warning"` / `[tether-cart-warning]`, with a
  `tether:cart-warning` event (API 2024-07 and later; older versions just skip it).
- Cart line links also keep the subscription plan (`selling_plan=`).
- `cart.subscribe` and `tether:cart-updated` now also fire when the saved cart has loaded.
- Discount codes: the form no longer becomes a page navigation with Astro's router; an invalid code
  gets `is-invalid` and is removed from the cart (it used to stay and repeat its warning).
- Another language: when Shopify translates option names (Size → Größe), `tether-option-list`,
  `tether-option` and `tether-option-selected` keep matching (by position).
- `Tether.query()` / `shop.query()` add the market to anonymous and shorthand queries too.
- `diagnose()` knows `tether-show="cart-warning"`.

**Markets:**

- `setCountry('DE', { locale: 'de-DE' })`, or a `locale` in a `markets.locales` entry for that
  country: the money format follows the country, and is remembered with it.
- `tether-countries="NL,DE"` limits a country select to your markets, in your order.
- With the Astro integration, `window.TETHER_CONFIG` in the layout no longer starts a second,
  unconfigured Tether.

## 0.4.0 (2026-11-04)

**Smaller:** the script every visitor loads went from 62.9 KB to 50.8 KB (20.7 → 17.1 KB gzipped,
15.4 KB brotli), while gaining the fixes below.

- Diagnose and markets are optional parts, loaded on first use (`tether.diagnose.min.js`,
  `tether.markets.min.js`, next to the main script; split chunks for bundlers). Self-hosting: copy
  them too, or set `partsUrl`. `Tether.detectMarket()` and `Tether.getLocalization()` now return
  promises.
- Built for ES2020 browsers (no helpers for `?.` and `??`), GraphQL minified at build time.

**TypeScript types** for the whole API, config, events and the Barba preset.

**Tested on a real Webflow site** (product pages, subscriptions, cart, Barba transitions), fixing:

- The cart drawer is now keyboard and screen-reader friendly: dialog semantics, focus moves in and
  back, Tab stays inside, `aria-expanded` on cart buttons (`cartFocus: false` to turn off).
- Add-to-cart links (not only buttons) get `aria-disabled` when unavailable.
- Products and lists that failed on a network error load again when the browser is back online.

**Releases in one step:** `npm run release -- X.Y.Z --push`; a workflow publishes to npm with
provenance (trusted publishing) and creates the GitHub Release.

The npm package shows the author link (occluze.com).

## 0.3.6 (2026-11-04)

- Fix: updates of deployed sync copies could be rejected by GitHub, because an Action's token may
  not change workflow files. The updater no longer touches `.github/`; the workflow file stays as it
  was deployed, and all update logic lives in `scripts/update-tether.mjs`, which updates itself.
  (Reverts the 0.3.5 workflow step.)
- On npm: `npm install @occluze/tether`.

## 0.3.5 (2026-11-04)

- Sync updates can't silently stall: after committing an update, the Update Tether action waits
  until Cloudflare has started the build, pushes again once if it hasn't, and fails visibly
  otherwise (GitHub emails you).
- New [comparison page](docs/comparison.md): Tether vs Smootify vs Storesynk (formerly Shopyflow),
  with sources. Fixed the competitor's name (Shopyflow, not "Shopiflow") in the description.

## 0.3.4 (2026-11-04)

- Shorter READMEs with what everyone needs; the full reference moved to `docs/reference.md`, the
  sync's technical details to `server/docs/advanced.md`.
- The README recommends `@0.3` on jsDelivr (every 0.3.x fix), with `@v0.3.4` to pin and `@latest`.
- Sync `/check`: the "update available" note reads versions from jsDelivr (GitHub's API rate-limits
  unauthenticated calls from Cloudflare). The updater also updates `docs/`.

## 0.3.3 (2026-11-04)

Tested live: Deploy to Cloudflare → first import into a Webflow collection → webhooks registered by
the Worker → create, rename, draft, re-activate and delete a Shopify product, each reflected in
Webflow within seconds.

- The Deploy form asks only for what a deploy needs: store domain, collection id, Webflow token,
  Shopify client id + secret, `SYNC_SECRET`. Optional settings are documented as secrets to add
  later (`FIELD_MAP`, `WEBFLOW_OWNED`, `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN`, `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
  `MAX_SUBREQUESTS`).
- No manual webhook setup: the Worker registers the product webhooks through the app on its first
  `POST /reconcile` (signed with the client secret). `/check` reports them; the CLI has
  `tether-sync webhooks <url>`. Webhooks signed with either the client secret or
  `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are accepted.
- `check` folds fields the collection doesn't have into one line instead of a warning per field.
- Deployed copies update themselves: `TETHER_VERSION` (`0.3` patches only, `0.3.3` pinned, `latest`)
  and an **Update Tether** GitHub Action in the copy (weekly, or Run workflow) that takes the newest
  matching release, tests it, commits it and lets Cloudflare redeploy. Mapping, Cloudflare ids and
  secrets are kept. The Action keeps its schedule alive, `/health` shows the running version, and
  `/check` warns when an update in the range hasn't been installed.

## 0.3.2 (2026-11-04)

- Worker: `POST /reconcile?since=all` (with `SYNC_SECRET`) runs a full first import without the CLI;
  if it doesn't fit in one run, the cron continues it.
- Fix: a half-done reconcile window that started from an explicit `since` is now resumed by the next
  run instead of being dropped.

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-04)

- Deploy to Cloudflare: the form starts empty (no example values), with clearer descriptions of
  what's required.
- Example values (`your-…`, `choose-…`, `…`) and a `SYNC_SECRET` shorter than 24 characters count as
  not set, so a left-over example can never unlock `/reconcile` or the API tests on `/check`.
  `check` names each such value.
- CI: actions/checkout and actions/setup-node v5 (Node 24).

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-04)

**Markets and localization**

- `markets: { detect: true, locales }`: country/language from the visitor's saved choice, your
  server (`window.TETHER_COUNTRY`, `<meta name="tether-country">`, a cookie such as one set from
  Cloudflare's `cf-ipcountry`) or Webflow Localization (locale subdirectory or `<html lang>`). No IP
  lookups from the browser.
- `select[tether-country-select]` (from `localization.availableCountries`) and
  `tether-country-bind`.
- `Tether.setCountry(code, { language })`: updates `@inContext`, the cart's
  `buyerIdentity.countryCode`, and re-renders products (keeping the selection) and lists. A saved
  cart from another market is moved on load. Events `country-changed`, `product-updated`.
- `Tether.getLocalization()`, `Tether.detectMarket()`; diagnose() shows the detected market.
- Switching ignores responses still on their way from the old market, keeps rendered products
  visible (`tether-state="updating"`), never creates a cart, and a saved choice applies without
  `detect`. Detached roots from page transitions are released.

**Shopify API upgrade safety**

- `scripts/api-version.mjs [--next]`; diagnose() names the version to upgrade to; a warning for
  `apiVersion: 'unstable'`.
- `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`: weekly and on push, tests + smoke on the pinned and the next API
  version; opens/updates an issue on failure.
- The smoke test covers the localization query and `setCountry`.

**Server sync**

- Deploy to Cloudflare button: `server/wrangler.jsonc` (KV binding, cron), secrets prompted from
  `.dev.vars.example`, descriptions in `package.json`.
- The config file now ships as a working default for a standard Products collection, with
  `SHOPIFY_DOMAIN` / `WEBFLOW_COLLECTION_ID` from the environment, `FIELD_MAP` / `WEBFLOW_OWNED`
  overrides, and `webflow.skipMissingFields` (on by default).
- `tether-sync check` is a guided first-run: what's missing, how to fix it, API and mapping tests, a
  sample item. Also at `GET /check` on the Worker (API tests only with `SYNC_SECRET`).
- Secrets set to `none` count as unset.
- Reliability (from a review of 0.2.0):
  - Product pages fit Shopify's 1,000-point query cost limit (25 variants, 10 images per product,
    ~19 products per page) and shrink on `MAX_COST_EXCEEDED`.
  - Reconcile budgets products, pages and subrequests (Worker: `MAX_SUBREQUESTS`, default 45), saves
    its exact position (page + offset) and never stalls on bulk edits; the window overlaps by
    `overlapMinutes`; a Shopify error saves progress instead of throwing.
  - Hashes are stored only after a successful publish; a failed publish is retried.
  - Duplicate items from concurrent runs are prevented (Webflow's unique slug: the loser adopts the
    winner's item); a created item's id is stored before publishing.
  - Webhook runs fail fast on long rate-limit waits and queue the product for reconcile.
  - The client-credentials token and the Webflow item index are cached in the store.
  - A draft product whose item was deleted in Webflow is no longer recreated; prune with
    `onDelete: 'unpublish'` no longer repeats.
  - `SYNC_SECRET=none` no longer opens `/reconcile`; `/check` without the secret hides values.
  - The Node state file batches writes, merges with other processes and recovers from a failed
    write.
- Fix: `server/src/worker.js` was excluded by `.gitignore` in 0.2.0.

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-04)

**Products without a Webflow CMS item**

- `tether-product="url:handle"` (any query parameter, e.g. `url:p`) and `url:path` (last path
  segment): one static page renders any Shopify product.
- `productPath` templates accept `{handle}` and `{id}`, e.g. `'/product?handle={handle}'`.
- `tether-page-title="{title} | Shop"` sets the document title.

**Robustness**

- State blocks: `tether-show="loading | ready | error | not-found"` in products and lists,
  `tether-show="cart-error"` for the cart. Blocks hidden by a Webflow class are shown too.
- Failed scopes get `tether-error` (`not-found` or an error code) and disabled add-to-cart buttons.
- Errors carry a `code` (`NOT_FOUND`, `NETWORK`, `HTTP_401`, …). New events `product-not-found` and
  `cart-error`; product and list failures also emit `error`.
- A failed cart load no longer forgets the cart when Shopify is only unreachable.
- `Tether.diagnose()`: config, API version support window, token reachability, selling plans and
  markup problems on the page.
- Documented `onError` for Sentry-style reporting and the Shopify API upgrade process.
  `npm run smoke` checks diagnose and not-found, and takes `TETHER_API_VERSION`.

**Server-side sync (new, `server/`)**

- Shopify → Webflow CMS sync for a Cloudflare Worker or a Node CLI: HMAC-verified product webhooks,
  idempotent `reconcile` cron with a cursor and a per-run budget, `import` with `--prune`,
  per-project field mapping with Webflow-owned fields, Webflow throttling, `check` command. See
  `server/README.md`.

## 0.1.3 (2026-11-04)

- `tether-bind="image:N"` binds the nth product image (e.g. a lifestyle shot), falling back to the
  featured image.

## 0.1.2 (2026-11-04)

- `tether-plan-list="true"` / `"all"` / `"*"` now list every plan, like an empty value (Webflow
  often can't save empty attribute values).

## 0.1.1 (2026-11-04)

- Fix: attributes on the product root element itself (e.g. a card link with `tether-bind="link"`)
  were ignored.

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-04)

First release.

- Products, variants, options, swatches, metafields, recommendations
- Product lists from collections or search, with load more
- Cart: add (single or many lines), update, remove, clear, note, attributes, discount codes, buyer
  identity, checkout (same or new tab), drawer
- Subscriptions via Shopify selling plans: one-time/subscribe toggle, plan list, subscription price
  and savings, change plan or switch to one-time in the cart
- Bundles / build-a-box with `tether-group`
- Markets via `@inContext(country, language)`
- Configurable attribute prefix (`prefix: 'wfs'` for older markup)
- Hooks for page transitions, scroll locks and animations; generic Barba/Lenis/GSAP preset
- Tolerates tokens without the inventory permission
